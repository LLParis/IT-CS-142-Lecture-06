    // SELF-CHECK PROBLEMS:
    // Note: you will need to put some of your answers inside a comments

    // Put your answer for #5A here:
    // 10

    // NOTE: FIRST try to predict what the output will be WITHOUT actually running the program
    // write down your answer here

    // NEXT run the program and see the results (you can copy-and-paste it here)
    // (I'm not including it in the starter project so that people don't just run
    //  it as the first thing they do :)  )

    // LASTLY compare the two results and if they're different go back and figure out
    // why the computer's output is different from what you predicted.

    // Put your answer for #5B here:
    // (Do this like #5A - predict, write your prediction, run the code, then explain any differences)
    // 0

    // Put your answer for #5C here:
    //5

    // Put your answer for #6 here:
    Random rand = new Random();
    int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(11);
    System.out.println(randomNumber);


    // Put your answer for #7 here:
    // Instead of correcting the code write a brief explanation of how to fix it
    // and include only the lines that you'll change

    // Put your answer for #9 here:

    // Put your answer for #12 here:

    // Put your answer for #16 here:

    // EXERCISES:

    // Put your answer for #1 here:
    // You will need to add the method in above main(), but then call it here

    // Put your answer for #12 here:
